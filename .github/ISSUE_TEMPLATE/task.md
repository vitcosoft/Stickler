## Task Description

[Clear description of the technical work needed and why it's necessary. Does it enable future features, resolve technical debt, improve maintainability, support architectural commitments, or establish infrastructure?]

## Technical Requirements

[Specific technical components, interfaces, classes, or infrastructure that need to be created or modified. Include any architectural patterns, performance requirements, or integration constraints that must be followed.]

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] [Specific technical deliverable or capability]
- [ ] [Another verifiable completion criterion]
- [ ] [Additional criteria as needed]

## Dependencies

**Requires:** [List blocking issues, external libraries, or infrastructure needs]

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] **Description clear and actionable** - Issue provides sufficient detail for implementation with clear acceptance criteria
- [ ] **Quality assured** - Unit, integration, performance, and regression testing requirements identified and planned
- [ ] **Thread safety implications** - Changes reviewed against established thread safety contracts
- [ ] **Performance impact** - Execution time, memory usage, and scalability implications evaluated
- [ ] **Documentation complete** - Updates planned for README, XML docs, Docus site, ADRs, and Mermaid diagrams as applicable
- [ ] **Compatibility and versioning** - Breaking changes identified with semantic versioning impact determined (major/minor/patch)
- [ ] **Rollback strategy** - Plan defined for reverting changes if implementation causes problems
- [ ] **Implementation approach validated** - Technical approach aligns with architectural commitments

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Technical components implemented according to requirements
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing for new components
- [ ] Integration with existing codebase validated
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] Quality checklist verified
